html predefined rules: 
1) Content is Everything
inline take height as width as per content
block elemet take 100 % width but height is deremained by content
2) Order comes from code. evey elemet is dispayed as per the order of the code
3) Childerne on top of parent

postioning : 
1) Static : like above
2) Relative : eg
postion: relative -- it does not affectthe postion of other element
left: 30px --top bootom left right
Rule while postioning: The first thing is that when you move an element that has a relative position,
it doesn't affect the position of anything else on screen.
3) Absolute
4) Fixed

Diff bet RElative and absolute: 
Just remember that relative positioning means that you're adding a margin relative to where the element
should have been,but absolute position means that you're adding a margin to its parent element.


Fixeed Positon: 
Due to Fixed postioning element stays exactly where it is fixed in its position relative to the body of the web site,
and it doesn't move despite all my scrolling.
So this is really useful if you have a nav bar that you that you want to be fixed so that it follows
the user as they scroll through your web site or sometimes you might have a side bar that you want to stay
fixed,
and this is how you would do it.
eg. 
position: fixed
top: 0px

Dark Art of Centering Element with CSS: 
Text-align center inside the container, or the parent element, will center everything inside that doesn't have a width set.
Now if it is a block element and it has a width set, then you're going to have to center it using this auto value in the margin.
So in this case we can also shorten this by saying that the top and bottom needs to be zero and the left and right needs to be auto.
eg. 
h1{	
margin: 0 auto 0 auto
}

How we can take an element out of the HTML flow by changing one particular CSS property?
That is of course the position property that we're going to change.
And we're going to change it from its current value which is static to absolute and that is how we're
going to remove it from the HTML flow.

Font Style: 
What can I do to ensure that everybody has the same viewing experience with regards to the fonts on

my web site?

Well, you could use something called font embedding.
So if we head over to fonts.google.com, then you can see that they've got a whole bunch of font
families that you can choose from.
And these are all fonts that are free for commercial use that you can simply embed into your website.

CSS sizing: 
16px=100%=1em
when you are using em or when you're using percentages, that value is inherited. ie.if we give 1em to body and 2em to body then  for h1 it will become
3em.
rem: remove parent em and conside only latest
